name: Refresh Data and Release

# 1. Run scrape from item-version-scrape
#   - Output to dist/Data.lua and upload artifact
#   - If cache has been updated, make a commit and push it back to save progress
# 2. On release branch, download new Data.lua artifact, and commit and push it.
#    (This is intentionally not done on master branch -- master branch has a
#    different lifecycle than the weekly data refreshes. master branch is where
#    we do development, and we don't want master's possibly-unfinished things to
#    be auto-merged into release branch every week.)
# 3. Run release workflow (see release.yml)
#
# This workflow is done automatically on Tuesdays at 16:00 UTC (1 hour after wow
# weekly reset), or by manual workflow_dispatch.
#
# This workflow requires a secret `ITEM_VERSION_SCRAPE_PAT` to be set up in the
# repository. This should be a personal access token created at
# <https://github.com/settings/tokens> with the following permissions:
#  - Repository access: t-mart/item-version-scrape
#  - Repositiory permissions
#    - Contents: Read and write
# It may need to be periodically regenerated if it expires, but you should get
# an email before it happens.
